# Victor Audio Design
Created by Benjamin Gabaldon Jan 24, 2018

## Audio philosophy:
Victor, much like Cozmo, will have a variety of families of sounds for communication.

Cozmo = finely tuned swiss watch. Hundreds of tiny, delicately interlaced gears and servos, driving all physical movements and intentions. 

Victor = highly sophisticated computer. Thousands of incredibly sleek components. Hydraulic, electrical, advanced technology. Less physical gears turning, and more 

## Voice:
Victor has a primary voice, that is for anything he intentionally wants to "say." This can be how he communicates to the user, or just to himself while he's thinking through something.

## Text to Speech (TTS):
Different from voice, Victor will also speak in localized languages, for the common utility uses. 

## Servo:
These are meant to allow Victor a physical sound to express a feeling, without requiring VO. Think of these sounds as "body language." A quick jump back, quick spin around, or shocked look up.

## Screen:
These are meant to allow Victor a facial expression sound to express a feeling or thought, without requiring VO. Think of these sounds as "facial expressions." Looking around, thinking to himself, blinking, getting upset, all can be supported by screen emotes.

## Locomotion:
All physical movements of the robot will function as loops that begin when the robot is "on." We will use the inputs of the actuators to drive volume and pitch RTPCs, so that the natural cadence and arc of synthtic sounds are in lock step with the physical movements.

## Display:
These are meant to for when Victor is providing information on his screen, creating a sense of "here you go." Displaying information takes some degree of effort, causing the screen to glow and hum with the projection.


## Backpack:
Victor's backpack can pulse in different patterns and colors, which would be nice to have subtle audio connected. There is no specific action or behavior attached to the lights yet, but probably should be.

## Misc SFX:
These are going to be extras, such as SFX for bored screen animations, scanning, anything that is specific for a purpose, that cannot be covered
