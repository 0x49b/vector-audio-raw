# Victor Head Board Analysis

Created by Jordan Rivas

I did a quick test to check the frequency response Victor head boards and speaker produce. We wanted to confirm that head board version P1, P2 & P3 sounded consistent and produced the audio as expected. We played a variety of sounds to check multiple conditions.

1. 1k Sign wave - Test simple sound and check for distortion
2. Pink Noise - Test Spectrum of frequencies
3. 20 hz - 20 kHz frequency sweep - Test frequency response
4. Mozart sound clip - Test clarity, dynamics and overall musical capabilities

Below are the frequency response chars for each head board. Due to room noise and minor mic speaker changes they are not completely consistent however they give us good idea of the frequency response.

P2 - Note: This was tested in a robot therefore there is more vibrations and harmonics from speaker housing.
